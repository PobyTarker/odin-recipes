# odin-recipes

This project is following The Odin Project's "Recipes" Project. 
I will be creating a somewhat simple webpage showcasing a particular recipe with various showcases of what I heave learned from the HTML course so far.

By the end of this project I expect to know how to confidently create the required webpage and possibly add some of my own twists to it as well.
