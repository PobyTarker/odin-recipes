    <h1> Cajun Chicken One Pot </h1>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>400g chicken breasts, chopped into large chunks</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Cajun-style seasoning</li>
            <li>400g can chopped tomatoes or passata</li>
            <li>1 chicken stock cube, crumbled</li>
            <li>500g penne or another tube- shaped pasta</li>
            <li>150ml double cream</li>
            <li>20g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>chopped parsley, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Method </h2>
        <ol>            
            <h4><li> Heat the olive oil in a large, shallow saucepan or deep frying pan over a medium heat, then add the chicken, season lightly and fry for 6-8 mins, stirring occasionally until just golden all over – no need to worry about it being cooked through at this stage. </li></h4>
            <h4><li> Stir in the garlic and cook for 2 mins more, then scatter over the Cajun-style seasoning and stir so the chicken pieces are evenly coated. Tip in the tomatoes, a quarter of a can of water and the stock cube. Stir, then bring to a simmer and cook for 5 mins. </li></h4>
            <h4><li> Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta for a minute less than pack instructions. Stir the cream into the chicken and continue to simmer gently. When the pasta is cooked, drain well and stir into chicken mixture. Finish cooking the pasta in the sauce over a low heat for 2 mins, then stir in the parmesan and lemon juice, and cook for 1 min more. Serve the pasta straight from the pan, or tip into a large serving bowl. Scatter with parsley, if you like, and extra parmesan. </li></h4>      
        </ol>
